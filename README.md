**Play now 👉 [froggy on itch.io](https://guyhev.itch.io/froggy)**

Froggy is a 2D platformer built in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) using GDScript. You play as a frog navigating through various levels and terrains, dodging obstacles, and collecting pineapples.

This project demonstrates my skills in game development, level design, player feedback systems, and API integration. It was developed as part of my personal portfolio to showcase my technical and creative capabilities.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎮 Tight and responsive controls  
- 🌍 Multiple platforming levels  
- 🌐 Online leaderboard using the [Dreamlo API](https://dreamlo.com/)    
- 🔊 Simple sound effects and animations  
- 💻 Exported to HTML5 and playable directly in browser

- **API**: [Dreamlo Leaderboard API](https://dreamlo.com/) 
- **Export**: HTML5 (Web Build via itch.io)  

## 📈 Leaderboards

The game uses the [Dreamlo API](https://dreamlo.com/) to store and display high scores based on completion time. Players submit their name and time at the end of each run, and results are fetched and sorted via HTTP.

## 📂 How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/froggy.git
2. Open the project with Godot and run

NOTE: When running locally, leaderboard won't work because API key isn't included, but this not affectes gameplay. 
      Dreamlo uses HTTP and not HTTPS like Talo.
